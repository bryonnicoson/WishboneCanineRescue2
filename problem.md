# Problem Statement


**Problem Statement**: Wishbone Canine Rescue needs a way to help place rescued dogs in caring permanent homes because they have continually have 50-60 dogs residing in temporary foster homes.

**Hypothesis**: We believe that by making these dogs more readily accessible for potential adopters we will achieve higher placement rates.  We will know this to be true when people report having used the app to help place dogs. 

**How Might We?**: 

* increase exposure of dogs to the public?
* increase placement rates for dogs?
* increase public knowledge of WBCR?
* increase donations & contributions to further shelter mission?
